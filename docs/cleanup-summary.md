# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Cleaned up the project structure by removing unnecessary files and directories that were created during testing.

## Removed Items

### 1. Test-Generated Directories
**Removed:**
- `/apis/` - Test scaffolding directory (contained only `generate.go`)
- `/internal/version/` - Duplicate of `pkg/version/`
- `/.idea/` - IDE configuration files

**Reason:** These directories were created during E2E testing and should not be part of the xp-provider-gen tool repository. They belong in generated provider projects, not the generator tool itself.

### 2. Unused Code Files
**Removed:**
- `pkg/rendering/` - Entire package (writer.go, updater.go, generator.go)

**Reason:** These files were created during refactoring but are not actually used anywhere in the codebase. The existing engine code handles all rendering and file writing operations.

### 3. Updated .gitignore

**Added entries to prevent future contamination:**
```gitignore
# Test-generated provider directories (should not be in tool repo)
/apis/
/internal/
/cluster/
/examples/
/hack/
/package/
LICENSE
OWNERS.md
```

**Reason:** Prevents accidentally committing test-generated provider files to the tool repository.

## Verification

### ✅ Build Success
```bash
make build
✓ Binary built successfully
```

### ✅ Tests Pass
```bash
go test ./pkg/...
✓ All tests pass
```

### ✅ E2E Test Success
```bash
# Complete workflow tested in /tmp/cleanup-test:
✓ init --domain=clean.io --repo=github.com/test/provider-clean
✓ create api --group=test --version=v1 --kind=Resource
✓ make generate && make build
✓ All quality checks pass
```

## Impact

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All functionality preserved
- E2E tests pass
- Generated providers work correctly
- Clean separation maintained

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner repository structure
- No confusion between tool code and generated code
- .gitignore prevents future contamination
- Clear distinction between generator and generated projects

## Conclusion

The project cleanup successfully removed test artifacts while maintaining all functionality. The repository now contains only the essential tool code with proper safeguards against future contamination.
